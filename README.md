# pycatlib

A small library for computing with finite categories. Made for use with the [SmallCategories](https://github.com/diracdeltafunk/SmallCategories) database.

## WARNING

This is really bad code, and there is no documentation! I just wrote this to do some quicky and dirty computations in order to populate the database for [smallcats.info](https://smallcats.info).
